# 3D Model Generation Tool (Shap-E Based)

This project demonstrates 3D asset generation from text prompts using OpenAI's **Shap-E** model. The output is in **.ply (Polygon File Format)**, making it compatible with 3D pipelines and game development workflows.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Environment Setup

```bash
cd mnt/extra

# Activate virtual environment
source shap-e-env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r shap-e/requirements.txt
````

---

## Model Usage

### Run the API Server

```bash
cd shap-e
python server.py
```

---

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                 | Description                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `/generate3d?prompt=...` | Generates a `.ply` 3D model     |
| `/status`                | Returns model status and uptime |

## Input / Output Samples

### Example Input Prompt

```
A futuristic chair with sleek design
```

### Output
